### OVERVIEW

The first production static website I designed and hosted in 2019 to challenge myself after graduation.

The goals of this design was to do the following:
- Create a online presence for the client
- Connect his social media to the website
- Offer a gallery to display their most recent work
- Provide contact methods for potential customers to ask for quotes
