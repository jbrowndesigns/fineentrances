### OVERVIEW

My first, professional type, static website I designed, coded and hosted in 2019 to challenge myself after graduation. Client no longer wanted to pay for services after switching from freelancing to contract. 
  
  <sup>*Website went through two design phases. Version 1's design was made on the whim while still being enrolled and not having a clear design plan. Can be found in the files...*</sup> 

The goals of this design was to do the following:
- Create a online presence for the client
- Connect thier social media to the website
- Offer a gallery to display their most recent work
- Provide contact methods for potential customers to ask for quotes

**Languages and Frameworks used:**

HTML, CSS, JQuery, Javascript(Lightbox v2.11.1 by Lokesh Dhakar)

**Features of Fine Entrances:**
```
- Single page layout with smooth scroll via JQuery
- Javascript module gallery for each category work work done
- Contact form was powered by JotForm for customers to request quotes. Form no longer visible.
```
